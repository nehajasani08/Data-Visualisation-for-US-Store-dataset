# Data-Visualisation-for-US-Store-dataset
The report below is for a US Superstore. The report would give us an overview on the sales activity of the store over a period of 4 years (2015-2018). For the companyâ€™s better sales performance and steady growth, it is important to know what are the factors that are contributing to the growth and which factor is leading to constant losses if any. Sales reporting is important to derive insights and examine whether the sales operations are successful and the strategies that were build as the foundation are proving to be efficient. We have chosen this dataset to analyse and generate some insights on the different categories of products sold by the Superstore. The data collected provides us with the basic information on the sales of Superstore, the orders received, and the returns made.
